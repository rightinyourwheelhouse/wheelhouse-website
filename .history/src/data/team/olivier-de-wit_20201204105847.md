qAndA:
  - q: "###### Describe yourself using only emojis"
    a: 🧑‍🏫🧑‍💻👪🎸🧑‍🍳
  - q: "What do you like the most about your job? "
    a: "It is a cliché, yet the absolute truth that working with people gives so
      much energy and is therefore my number 1 motivator. "
  - q: "What does your average day look like? "
    a: >-
      I am usually woken up (stamped around my bed) at 7am by my 3 lovely
      children.

      Around 8.30 am, I drive my kids to school, after a hilarious 'rush to school' ritual.

      The peace and quiet at home (Corona, you know) returns around 8.45am, where I start my working day.

      Reading and responding e-mails, virtually interviewing future Wheelies, making presentations, doing 1-1’s, attend project meetings, writing marketing content and sales offers are my most recurring tasks during work. Usually, I try to pick up the kids around 5u30pm, where the 'rush to bed' ritual begins. The comforting sound of sleeping children provides time for leisure, which often translates into playing the silent piano, or guitar.

  - q: "Must read. "
    a: The 7 habits of highly effective people is in my opinion a must read for

  - q: "Most useless fact: "
    a: "I don't like dogs. "
