## ☕ Setup

Install node_modules with `npm install`.


More information about that: https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/beta-features/#working-with-a-local-git-repository

### Website

1. Run `cp .env.example .env` file in the project folder.
2. Update all the `xxxxxx` values, here's where to find each:
  #### Website
  - `RECRUITEE_TOKEN` - You can find this in your recruitee profile settings (or ask a collegue)

4. (initial deployment). Fill in the Website values on Netlify.

### Netlify CMS
For using the CMS offline you can use:

```shell
npx netlify-cms-proxy-server
```

in your local .env file you also need to add:

```
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 🧰 Development

```shell
npm start
```

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

> ⚠️ **Important!** <br />_Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

## 🚀 Deployment

### Netlify
This is setup to work seamlessly with Netlify. **Add these website `.env` variables to the Netlify Project**

`RECRUITEE_TOKEN`
