          Talent goes beyond any label. For us, your gender identity, sexuality,

          Did you know that research proved male candidates apply for a job when
          they check off 60% of the requirements, whereas women need to
          recognize themselves 100% in the job before even considering it? So,
          dear job seeker, ignore the qualifications, and letâ€™s see if we are a
          good match.
