It might not be surprising that this is most of the time quite disappointing. Last week, I got introduced to womendotcode and itâ€™s a community that aims to unite women who code in Belgium. Feel free to join or share with your fellow female developers!",

      "description": "Before Corona put the world on a leash, I listened to podcasts on a daily basis. Recently, I rediscovered podcasts and now I listen to them when I go on a run. No such thing as a fish always brings a smile to my face, even though people I pass by probably think I'm crazy because it looks like I'm laughing randomly.",

      "description": "I found a treasure of electronics explanation videos by an electronics professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Especially the videos on analog sound are what interest me the most. He goes over some ancient and legendary synth modules from famous brands like Moog and Buchla. Most of the theory behind analog sound engineering is very specific, and understanding them makes debugging a circuit a lot easier when things go wrong when you build a synthesizer module. They don't teach you at school what Rossum compensation is in a VCO. ðŸ˜‰",
