      "description": "\\\nRecently i stumbled upon Bionic Reading and found it pretty interesting, this way of reading revises texts so that the most concise parts of words are highlighted. This guides the eye over the text and the brain remembers previously learned words more quickly. I thought about how you may implement this on the web when handling long sections of text, because everybody knows users donâ€™t read text when itâ€™s long and boring.\n\n![Example bionic reading](/assets/bionic-reading-example.jpeg \"Example bionic reading\")",

My speculation is that most of the websites of small businesses could be stored this way and could have a great environmental impact as we could eliminate a lot of wasted energy on a large number of servers. We just need better browser support and a different kind of search engine to see this becoming a realisation I guess.",

This is particularly nice if you have the habit of separating your local changes into different commits. Or like to commit only a specific piece of code and still have linting errors in another.",

Instead of spending hours on hours animating your SVGâ€™s with CSS, designers can create an animation in After Effects and export it as a Lottiefile using a plugin. It outputs a JSON file that describes the animation and can be used in your favorite framework.",

This is a cross-platform native runtime that makes it easy to build modern web apps that run natively on iOS, Android, and the Web. Representing the next evolution of Hybrid apps, Capacitor creates Web Native apps, providing a modern native container approach for teams who want to build web-first without sacrificing full access to native SDKs when they need it.",
