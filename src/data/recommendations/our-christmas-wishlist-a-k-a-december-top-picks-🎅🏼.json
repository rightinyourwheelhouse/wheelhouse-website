      "description": "This is one of my dream sneakers: the winner of the Air Max Day 2018. The shoe tells the story that Sean had in mind when he moved to LA. It has a lot of cool little easter eggs. For instance, when you put the shoe on, you will see a smiley face. Or the waves of the see when you pull your shoe up.

      "description": "I like to write notes down on paper instead of on my PC. The slower process of writing by hand allows your brain to think and concentrate on what it is you are writing about.

      "description": "When designing prototypes, wireframes or just experimenting, I find it often hard to come up with copy text, definitely when you are just building out a wireframe or just testing something. Instead of just using Lorem Ipsum I now use Flow: a typeface build for visually improving your non-existing copy. I like it a lot because it looks better when presenting your prototype or when showcasing it.",
