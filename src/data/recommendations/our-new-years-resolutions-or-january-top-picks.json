      "description": "Before the pandemic hit, I wanted to go back to Peru. Unfortunately, I had to cancel everything, but I've been wanting to get back at it. This time, we want to do the Inca Trail because the dreaded train is the most expensive railway per km in the entire world. Apart from that, I've been creating a lot of instruments and synthesizers in the last couple of years, and I kind of quit putting out any music since 2018. Finding inspiration and motivation can be tough at times, and I was hoping to go for a more organic approach with the new instruments.",

      "description": "It may seem like a basic resolution, but I had this one on my list for a while now. Last year, I couldn't participate in the Antwerp 10 miles because of shin splints, but now I'm recovered, I have started training again. Hopefully, I won't be injured this year.",

      "title": "Spend more time in the pool",
      "description": "When I was younger, I would spend a lot of my free time in the swimming pool training for swimming contests. While it improved my physical fitness, I also noticed how at peace I was after a training session. Over the years, my free time became scarce and the number of times I went swimming declined. The whole corona situation didn't help either. So for my New Year's resolution and the sake of my physical and mental well-being, I want to spend more time in the pool or doing other physical activities.",

      "description": "Before Covid-19, I used to go out and loved to go to places with my friends. However, the pandemic changed that. Now I only stay inside and do activities online with my friends. Hopefully, I can do things again with my friends soon. In addition, I hope to see my friends who aren't as active online. I really want to escape my trap of being inside all day. So for this year, I want to do fewer things online and do more in person.",
