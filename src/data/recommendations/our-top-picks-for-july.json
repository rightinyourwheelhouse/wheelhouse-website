      "description": "Many, many people will use Moment.js when it comes to handling Dates and Times in JS. Also, many, many people don't realize Moment.js is DONE. It's no longer being actively developed on, and while it will continue to work the way it used to in your older projects, perhaps it's time for a switch in your newer ones. \n\nI've been using DayJS for some time now and it basically has everything you need from timezones, to locales, and even far beyond that with their plugins. There are other alternatives like Luxon, date-fns, and js-Joda, but I have mainly gotten to like DayJS in the past few... days. ðŸ™ƒ",

      "description": "Most of us never actually get to see it, because once you are logged in, you usually skip it. The homepage of Github is actually really nice. \n\nThe artwork is great and it has a globe that shows you live interactions of people around the world using it. In my opinion, it's a great piece of coding. It's a shame that the users of Github never get to see it.",

      "description": "I listened to the diversity talk of Ayla Cremmery, ICT Lady of the Year 2021, which was truly inspiring. She talked about the importance of diversity in IT and why the lack of women in tech companies has an impact on the applications made. This is why She Goes ICT is my pick of the month because initiatives like this are important!",
