You can also share your workroom with someone else (I never tried it, though). It‚Äôs still pretty new with only a few features, but hopefully, they will expand their options.",

While playing, I truly felt the passion of the developer. They are actively developing the game, and you can find frequent updates detailed in a nice devlog.\n\nAt the start of March, the games' demo was unlocked to be the full game because the developer wanted people to \"spend their money on something important and help someone in need.\"",

Yuri goes in-depth on how some visuals are created, which he does entertainingly.

Nothing grinds my gears as much as listening to my favorite music from a crappy Bluetooth speaker from ‚ÄòDen Aldi.‚Äô There is only one source of audio that completely satisfies my audio needs, and that is¬†**vinyl**. This is why I finally bought a turntable. It offers high-quality audio and ease of use in a beautiful but affordable retro package.",

It's insane what can be done with it. 16 step sequencer with BPM and Swing. 16 sound banks over which you can record, 16 patterns, and the option to loop a sequence of them. 16 effects that make live remixing an actual thing. All of that fits in your hand, pocket, and runs off of 2 AA batteries. Has a line-in and out too. Teenage engineering has not disappointed me thus far.",
