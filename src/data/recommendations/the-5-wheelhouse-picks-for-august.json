      "description": "Thanks to COVID-19, all Wheelhouse employees are working from home. This makes video calls a daily thing. Personally, we like how we are rethinking our way of working in a team. However, there are some downsides when working remotely. One main issue is presenting or pitching in a Zoom call. In a presentation, the presenter is usually supported by their slides. In a video conference, everyone is just looking at the slides and this way, you lose a lot of non-verbal communication. This is where mmhmm comes into the picture. mmhmm created an application where you can bring that presenting magic back. By combining your webcam video with your screen, you can decide how big or small one or the other is. You can even collaborate with other people as well, so they can continue their part of the presentation with the same slides without having to switch screens. Essentially, you can have total control over how your presentation is perceived.",
