      "description": "Thanks to COVID a lot of us are working from home. That made video calls an everyday thing and we personally like how we are rethinking our way of working in a team. However, there are some downsides and one main issue is presenting or pitching in a Zoom call. In a presentation the presenter is supported by its slides. In a video conference everyone is just looking at your slides and you lose a lot of non-verbal communication. Here comes mmhmm in the picture. They created an application where you can bring that magic back. By combining your webcam video with your screen you can decide how big or small one of the other is. You can even collaborate with other people as well so they can continue their presentation with the same slides without having to switch screens. You can be back creative and having control over how your presentation is coming forward!"
