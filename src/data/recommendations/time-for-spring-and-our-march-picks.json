      "description": "Each year for Christmas, I receive puzzles from my uncle. This year, he gifted us a year-puzzle. It permanently sits on the morning table and consists of several pieces that should form a cube when put together. This one, in particular, is a TIC (Turning Interlocking Cubes), which is by nature very difficult to solve. My uncle sent me a neat little software that can effectively simulate solving such puzzles. It's free, and it looks impressive too! Still, I haven't given up on trying to solve it myself.",

      "description": "I recently started to look at EVs. This website helps me determine how much the actual range is for the vehicle I'm interested in. It shows all different kinds of data, like the cost of the car, the range in different seasons, and how fast it goes from 0km-120km. It can also compare the different cars in the same price range. So you can get the most out of your money.",

      "description": "A book (written by Daniel Schiffman) that serves as a good starting point if you'd be interested in writing simulations based on nature's unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties. The book manages to break down multiple phenomena into small comprehendible pieces, so you'll quickly be able to experiment with your concepts. The examples in the book are made with 'Processing,' a java library used for visual arts. Luckily, [a youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70MQ-FugwbI&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM) created by the man himself covers the same material as in the book with p5.js for all javascript enthusiasts!",

This plugin makes it really easy to search a certain page. Combining this with a mac shortcut (I use command + shift + f -> same as searching in Webstorm) and it works like magic. 🙏🏼",
