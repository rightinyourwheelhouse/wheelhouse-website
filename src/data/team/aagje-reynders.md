qAndA:
  - q: How do you cut your pizza?
    a: I don't cut my pizza, but eat it with knife and fork. That way I get to keep
      the better parts separate.
  - q: What does your average day look like?
    a: |-
      * wake up at 7
      * stand-up at 9
      * whatever happens between 9 and food.
