    a: When I was 14 years old, I played this Runescape remake with friends and met
      the person who made it, I was really interested in how he managed to code
      it. So I started to look things up and learned myself how to program.
  - q: "Fun fact:"
    a: As a kid I was really impressed how my father could “talk to computers”.
      Thats how he explained me what he was doing. Little did I know that he was
