  - q: "What's the best place you've traveled to? "
    a: >-
      As I did one of my internships at an animal shelter in Zambia, I must
      definitely say Southern African countries stole my heart. During my
      internship, I visited places in Zambia (Victoria Falls is definitely high
      on my list!), Zimbabwe, Botswana, and Cape Town in South Africa. Two
      months of saving animals combined with traveling - a dream come true! üåç

  - q: What's your role at Wheelhouse?
    a: "As a Marketing Manager for Wheelhouse, I make sure digital marketing is on
      point. üöÄ To summarize my job: I make sure the team is seen on social
      media, I write blogs and share the team's insights, make visuals, come up
      with campaigns. I basically do anything that's marketing-related."
  - q: What's your favorite food?
    a: That's a hard choice. As long as it's vegetarian, I love it! Maybe pizza? Or
      fries? Or tacos? Or salads? (I guess you can imagine the struggle of my
      boyfriend asking me what I want to eat). üçïü•óüçüüåÆ
  - q: "Can you speak more than one language? "
    a: "Yes, actually! I can speak and write in: Dutch (Flemish), English, French,
      Spanish, and some rusty German. Some better than the other. ü§™"
  - q: "Are you a cat or a dog person? "
    a: >-
      I used to be a dog person. I even worked in a dog hotel for four years as
      a student. Since I moved to live on my own, I got a little cat called
      Maurice a.k.a. Momo and he stole my heart. I would consider myself as a
      dog-and-Momo person now. ‚ù§Ô∏è 


      Fun fact: my favorite breeds are golden retrievers, dwarf dachshunds, and white shepherds.
