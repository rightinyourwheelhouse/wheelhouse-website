Over the years, Daren has done projects for a multitude of companies ranging from small to big. That way he learned a lot in a small amount of time. Now there is nothing he rather does than share his knowledge so the web becomes a better place. 

He finds it important that a user comes first. If the user has a nice experience it will automatically result in whatever the applications goal is. On top of that the user will feel good about it. As a front-end developer it’s your goal to make that as smooth as possible.
