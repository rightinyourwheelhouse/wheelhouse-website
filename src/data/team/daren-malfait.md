      1. **My macbook pro:** it's my workhorse

      2. **Input devices:** I use a wireless apple keyboard and mainly the magic trackpad. Sometimes I use the magic mouse when I feel more like clicking than tapping.

      3. **My main display:** Not much to add here. I tend to only use one display at a time. That way my focus stays on the one thing. I use multiple if I'm actively comparing code.

      4. **My wireless headphones**

      5. **Raspberry pi:** I use my raspberry pi for a multitude of stuff. It's amazing!
  - q: Why do you prefer front-end over back-end?
    a: I love writing code, but I also love design and UX. As a front-end developer
      I usually get the chance to get the best of both worlds.
  - q: What podcasts are you currently listening to?

Over the years, Daren has done projects for a multitude of companies ranging from small to big. That way he learned a lot in a small amount of time. Now there is nothing he rather does than share his knowledge so the web becomes a better place. 

He finds it important that a user comes first. If the user has a nice experience it will automatically result in whatever the applications goal is. On top of that the user will feel good about it. As a front-end developer it’s your goal to make that as smooth as possible.
