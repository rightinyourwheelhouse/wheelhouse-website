qAndA:
  - q: "Describe yourself using only emojis:"
    a: 🍺 🤘 🍳 😄
  - q: Do you like anime?
    a: Yes, I like anime! I already watched 203 seasons of different animes.
  - q: Where will we find you on a Friday evening?
    a: >-
      Friday is the day to call some friends and hang out. This can go from
      going to the pub or having a board game evening. Games like Carcassonne or
      Catan are the favorites at this moment.

  - q: Where do you like to travel?
    a: >-
      Going to Japan is still on my bucket list. Exploring the culture and the
      different types of food. Of course, I watched too much anime so that is
      probably the reason why I’m looking forward to visiting it. \

      The trip is planned now, we hope that Corona won't rise again when we want to go.
  - q: What do you do when you’re not coding?
    a: >-
      I like to cook/brew/bake anything which fascinates me. It started with
      brewing my own beer and from that point, it escalated. Not only do I like
      to drink something, but I like to eat something with it. That’s why I also
      started with making some Gouda cheese. So who knows what I will make in
      the future.

  - q: Which JavaScript framework do you prefer?
    a: In the end, I don’t think it matters which framework you prefer. As long we
      create clean and readable code which easily is to debug then it should not
      matter. But if I had to choose I would go to Angular because this one I
      have the most experience with.
