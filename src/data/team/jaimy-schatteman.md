qAndA:
  - q: If you were an animal, what would you be?
    a: I’ve been in the Boy Scouts for most of my life. It is a tradition that
      everyone there gets a so-called totem. A totem is the name of an animal
      with the same characteristics as the person it is given to. It is supposed
      to enforce the group spirit and offer a chance to get to know yourself
      better. My totem is a
      [Seal](https://www.scoutsengidsenvlaanderen.be/totemzoeker/zeehond). 🦭
  - q: Describe yourself using only emojis
    a: 🎶 🏊‍⚜️ 👨‍🍳 🤡
  - q: What do you like to do with your friends?
    a: >-
      Most of my friends are really into music. When we are together, we like to
      experiment with our favorite tracks and blend them together.

  - q: What is the dumbest way you’ve been injured?
    a: >-
      Although the injury wasn’t really painful, I do think it makes up for it
      in stupidity. On a beautiful summer day, I faced a serious problem. I had
      an unrefrigerated drink in a bottle and it was really hot outside. In the
      corner of my eye, I spotted a bag filled to the brim with ice cubes.
      Obviously, the ice cubes were too large for the opening of the glass
      bottle and I had nothing else at hand to put my drink in. 


      So, I tried to push the ice cube into the bottle with my hands. Sadly, this was harder than I thought it would be. I suddenly thought of a solution. What if I tried to ram it in the bottle with my teeth? IT WORKED! However, when it finally slipped through, my teeth hit the bottle and a piece chipped off never to be found again...
  - q: Which three items would you take with you to a deserted island?
    a: A boat, my cellphone (Spotify), and some quality speakers to enjoy the ride
      home.
  - q: When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?
    a: I really liked animals during my childhood and loved to read about them. I
      liked them so much that I told my parents I wanted to work at a zoo. When
      they told me I also had to clean up their 💩, the love was over… Nah, just
      kidding, but judging on where I stand now, my ambitions have changed a
      bit.
