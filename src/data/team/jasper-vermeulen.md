qAndA:
  - q: What's on your desk?
    a: "![The cleanest desk you've ever seen](assets/untitled.png \"The cleanest
      desk you've ever seen\")"
  - q: Describe yourself using only emojis
    a: 💻🏕️🐶🗺️
  - q: What's the best place you've traveled to?
    a: During high school, I went on an exchange program to China, Beijing. I was in
      China for around 10 days and during those days I made connections and
      experiences that will last forever, one of the coolest periods of my life.
      As soon as I can, I’ll go back to the other side of the world!
  - q: A book you're currently reading
    a: "Currently, I’m reading ‘Atomic Habits’ by James Clear, a book that teaches
      you how to design habits that are for you rather than against you. It’s
      funny: I need to make a habit of reading more but how can I ‘design’ the
      habit if I don’t read more and don't finish the book. 🤨"
  - q: Fun fact?
    a: |-
      I’m a dog person, my best friend is my dog!

I’m Jasper, I am a digital designer and developer. I’m very interested in JavaScript and all the frameworks behind it, that’s why I joined Wheelhouse. During summer, you can find me on summer camps with Kazou!
