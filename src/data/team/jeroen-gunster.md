qAndA:
  - q: Describe yourself using only emojis
    a: 🎧🧑🏻‍💻🐱🎾🏎️
  - q: What hobby would you like to pick up one day?
    a: >-
      During the pandemic, I've been flirting with the idea of picking up
      miniature painting as a hobby, but I haven't really committed to it yet.
      It's not that I haven't made any steps yet, because I've been already
      watching endless amounts of YouTube video's on the topic and I've already
      bought brushes, paints, an airbrush, material for miniature bases and even
      installed a pegboard in my office to store my supplies. However, applying
      my first stroke of paint is still too scary for the time being.


      Maybe one of these days I'll find the courage...
  - q: What's your favorite food?
    a: >-
      Homemade nachos are definitely my number one food of all time. I'm kind of
      a self-proclaimed nacho-making specialist. This is how I like them:


      1. (first layer) some quality nachos, green and red bell peppers, sliced black olives, chopped shallots, jalapeños, ground beef, homemade salsa and some hot cheese dip from Colruyt topped with some mixture of grated cheddar and mozzarella.

      2. (second layer) do exactly the same as the first layer.

      3. Bake this blend of deliciousness for 10 mins in the oven.
  - q: What's the coolest place you've been to?
    a: >-
      I've seen some really cool places on this globe, but if I must pick one,
      then I guess I'll pick this mysterious circle of stones next to the sea in
      Malta.


      We were hiking to the Wied il-Ghasri cliffs in Gozo, which is the big island in the north of Malta. And during our walk, we suddenly stumbled upon this place.


      The contrast between the brutality of the waves crashing into the rocks and right next to it a very peaceful and structured arrangement of stones had a very surreal feel to it.


      So, if you're ever in Malta, I'd definitely recommend taking this route, because even without this structure it is a very beautiful hike in a wonderful part of Malta.

  - q: What is your favorite movie?
    a: >-
      Children of Men.


      For me, this is truly a masterpiece of a film. The attention to detail and believability of its worldbuilding is on another level.


      Also, the acting and the cinematography are superb, like there are multiple impressive long single takes in the movie that are on the verge of unbelievable.


      If you haven't seen this one yet, go watch it! TODAY!!
  - q: What are the names of your pets?
    a: >-
      *Left* - Lester (a.k.a. The boiii)


      *Right -* Peach (or the Poetchie for friends)

Jeroen has a great passion for web development and has been teaching himself the in's and out's on this subject for the last couple of years. His interests tend to extend outside of development too, as he actively tries to stay on top of relevant processes connected to web dev, like UI/UX design, and SEO.

Outside of work, you're likely to find him tinkering on his Creality Ender 3, a 3D Printing machine... Or setting new personal best records in his new PlaySeat Challenge gaming chair.
