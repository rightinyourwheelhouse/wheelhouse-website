  - q: How did you become passionate about nature?
    a: It runs in the family, I grew up between plants. The fascination really hit
      when I grew tomatoes for the first time. Watching how a tiny seed grows
      into a giant plant and then feeding yourself with it gave me a deeper
      understanding of how everything in nature and the universe follows this
      principle. **The circle of life**. In web development, you experience that
      as well. Everything starts with a seed/idea and with the right tools and
      circumstances, grows into a beautiful specimen/application.

  - q: Why did you become a web developer?
    a: As a web developer, you’re learning and creating on a daily basis. As
      technology is evolving at lightning speed, programming provides a great
      way to build tools and find solutions to make life a bit more easy and
      manageable.
