qAndA:
  - a: Wake up variably at around 8 AM, ready in 30 mins. Make myself a coffee,
      eating some breakfast (can’t do without it). I will take the time to
      schedule my day work-wise and see if there’s any calls. Lunch around 1 PM.
      Since Corona I usually mix my work with everyday tasks like groceries and
      barbers. Around 5-6 PM I study some music. The rest of the evening I work
      on one of my crazy non-code projects, or watch some series.
    q: What does your average day look like?
  - q: What do you like most about your job?
    a: I like the variety and autonomy.
  - q: Why are you Full-Stack Consultant?
    a: I don’t consider myself specifically specialised in either Front- or
      Back-end. I like to see the bigger picture in projects, and as a
      full-stack engineer you get to see all sides of this bigger picture.
  - q: What’s your most useless talent
    a: Really good at driving backwards in bumper-cars. You won’t expect me
      reversing into you!
  - q: What’s your craziest invention?
    a: >-
      ![Synth](assets/syth.png "Synth")


      My HelloFresh synthesizer, even though I’m sure the guys at HelloFresh don’t have a clue.
  - q: Would you rather be deaf or blind?
    a: Blind, I’m already blind, lol. Deafness would really mean the end of my life.
  - q: Most influential album you’ve listened to
    a: Boards Of Canada - The Campfire Headphase
