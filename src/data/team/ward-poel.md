      * My 13" **Macbook Pro** and 2 external displays
      * **Mouse**
      * All the magic code I write goes through my **wired keyboard** 👀
      * My **AirPods** and my headset 🎵
      * For backups, I use a **Raspberry Pi** that I turned into a NAS
  - q: What does your average day look like?
    a: Usually, I wake up at 8 o'clock, well... let's say... I try to. 😴  After
      waking up, I prepare a small breakfast and move myself to my desk. During
      my workday I try to be as productive as possible, however, this isn't
      always easy when working from home. Most of my time goes to developing new
      features or fixing bugs. Sometimes, I need to hop into a meeting. After my
      workday in non-Corona-times, I play table tennis three times a week. I
      also love to learn about new technologies in my spare time.
  - q: What do you like most about your job?
    a: I love to learn and work with new technologies, and it's awesome that I get
      the opportunity to do this at Wheelhouse.
  - q: What are your hobbies?
    a: |-
      Table tennis 🏓  and mountain biking 🚵‍♂️
